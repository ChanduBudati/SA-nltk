Very oily and creamy. Not at all what I expected... ordered this to try to highlight and contour and it just looked awful!!! Plus, took FOREVER to arrive.

This palette was a decent price and I was looking for a few different shades. This palette conceals decently, however, it does somewhat cake up and crease.

The texture of this concealer pallet is fantastic, it has great coverage and a wide variety of uses, I guess it's meant for professional makeup artists and a lot of the colours are of no use to me but I use at least two of them on a regular basis, and two more occasionally, which is the only reason I'm giving it for stars, I feel like the range of colors is kind of a waste for me, but the  product itself  is wonderful, it's not cakey, gives me a natural for and concealed my imperfections, therefore I highly recommend it :)

I really can't tell what exactly this thing is. It's not powder but a kind of oil-ish pasty fluid. And so far I tried twice but it doesnt really show any color on my face.

It was a little smaller than I expected, but that was okay because it lasted me for a long time. I think it does great coverage for the price I paid. It is heavy, and wears off within 30-1hr. It kinda dries your skin. I'd recommend it to people who are just looking for a cheap coverage, or beginners who are just learning to conceal.
